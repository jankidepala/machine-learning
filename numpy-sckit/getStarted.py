#NumPy provides basic numerical functions, especially for multi-dimensional arrays and mathematical computation.

#SciPy builds on NumPy to provide features for scientific applications.

#matplotlib provides plotting and related graphic display capabilities. Its function set is intended to be quickly usable by people who are familiar with Matlab, although it is built entirely on top of Python and thus can be integrated with any other Python-based application.

#ipython is an enhanced conversational interface that allows you to interact with Python in parallel with a running application.
